# officernd-api

Unofficial [OfficeRnD](https://officernd.com) Version 1 - OpenAPI 3 specification.

The [OfficeRnD Public API](https://developer.officernd.com) is designed to let 3rd party applications communicate
with the core [OfficeRnD](https://officernd.com) platform. Unfortunately the developer documentation is provided
as-is, in HTML, without a specification.

This unofficial specification is provided for all your code generation needs.

## WARNING

**UNSAFE:** [OfficeRnD](https://officernd.com) only publish a major version number so this specification may not match
the documentation or API if the endpoints used by [Techspace](https://techspace.co) remain functional. It is provided
on a best effort basis.

**UNSAFE:** [OfficeRnD](https://officernd.com) documentation is incomplete and resources are missing large numbers of
undocumented fields. Generated code is most likely not round trip safe. We suggest avoiding writes using the
[OfficeRnD Public API](https://developer.officernd.com) where possible until the API improves.
